    <p>
      My full name is Jah'swill Uchechi Emmanuel and I am currently a student of
      AltSchool Africa with <b>ALT SCHOOL ID: ALT/SOE/024/0890</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born on the 15th of December 2008 in Gusau, Zamfara State, but I am
      currently residing in Owerri North, Imo State with my parents. My parents
      are one of the most loving people I have on earth right now and I am the
      first out of three boys that my parents gave birth to. I am a Secondadry
      School Graduate having finished and rounded up with my Senoir Secondary
      Certificate Examinations (SSCE) last year. In my early childhood I grew up
      in the North, Zamfara State to be precise and after my SSCE examinations
      my parents decided to relocate to the East, Imo State.
    </p>
    <h3>Reasons for Joining AltSchool Africa</h3>
    <p>
      I have been learning and mastering my skills in the area of Graphic Design
      ever since we relocated to Imo State, and I have always been looking out
      for new ways to further my skills in other areas of the Tech Industry and
      that is one of the main reasons I enrolled for AltSchool Africa, so that I
      can build myself up in the area of Software Development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love technology very much and I want to build a career in tech and be
      amonng the people who have a share in Shaping the world of technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one may ask why not any Traditional University? Well as for me i don't
      feel like any Traditional University can help me to master my Software
      Developing skills due to the many problems that i see in conventional
      Universities such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Outdated Curriculum</li>
      <li>Limited Access to Resources</li>
      <li>Inadequate Practical Exposure</li>
      <li>Insufficient Industry Links</li>
      <li>Lack of Qualified Instructors</li>
      <li>Poor Infrastructure</li>
      <li>Inadequate Training Exercises</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Therefore when I learnt through a friend who just passed out from
      AltSchool Africa about the many oppurtunities that AltSchool had to offer
      and the benefits i could derive from schooling with them, I became more
      eager to learn more about the school and when I went on to make my
      research about AltSchool, the praises where just too much and so i decided
      to enroll for the Frontend Engineering Course so that I could also share
      my own wonderful stories and success with the world.
